Hello! you must be looking in my skin folder, the .git folder is from github, this is a clone of the repo MPP-osu, (my repo)

so just ignore that folder

some of this stuff is unused some of it in its original pdn format, theres even an exe somewhere in here that i used to downscale the image, i recomend it.

you're probably wondering why this skin has a readme.

why not?

just saying, you can use any of these sprites in your own skin on the osu! website, as long as you give credit.

if you're seeing this in comic sans im surprised it saved with the font

the ranking images and some sounds are taken from (codename) osu!lazer, the future of osu!.

dont run the exe in here, you'll be confused and probably mess either mpp up, or another skin of yours.

if you have any questions just send a message on discord to me, Hubz#0302 - or send me an email at hubz@hub2hub.xyz

did you enjoy reading this i hope you did lol

first readme i've ever wrote.

dunno what to write here


some more stuff: 
if you're not one of my friends that means my skin made it to the osu!forums or somewhere along there, or has just gone around discord, thats awesome! i'd love to hear what you think of the skin

i'll update this txt if i need to, bye!
